INSTALL i3WM
------------

sudo apt install i3-wm

REMOVING DISPLAY MANAGER lightdm
--------------------------------

To boot to console:

sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target

You must then edit /etc/default/grub by removing splash from the GRUB command
line. (Remember to update GRUB afterward: sudo update-grub).

To get to the Unity desktop from the console, you must enter the command:

sudo systemctl start lightdm.service

(The usual startx command doesn't work with Unity.)

To restore boot to GUI:

sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

CONFIGURING .xsession AND .xinit FILES
--------------------------------------

startx will start X by first invoking xinit.

xinit will look for a ~/.xinitrc file in the user's home directory, to run as a
shell script.

xinitrc is used to set up a suitable X environment, and to launch other
programs, a.k.a "clients" that we may want available as soon as X is started.

The Window Manager, or desktop environment, is typically the last application
started.

The other, more common, approach is the "GUI log-in", where X is running before
log-in. X includes xdm (X Display Manager) for this purpose.

Now, ~/.xsession for xdm is the rough equivalent of ~/.xinitrc for startx.

Depending on how you start X, either the ~/.xinitrc or the ~/.xsession file will
be executed by the server.

Finally, if you execute i3wm from ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession, then i3wm will read
its initial configuration from ~/.i3/config.

Done.

Given that, you may like to maintain single version of your personal startup
script for X:

Create the script ~/.xinitrc with your initial settings.

Make symbolic link for xdm equivalent:

$ ln -s $HOME/.xinitrc $HOME/.xsession

CONFIGURING ~/.xinitrc FOR i3wm 
-------------------------------

exec i3

CONFIGURING ~/.i3/config
------------------------

exec --no-startup-id "setxkbmap -model pc105 -layout us,ru -option grp:caps_toggle"
bindsym Mod1+d exec rofi -show run
